- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelAsistinARC
- 👀 I’m interested in Citizen Development, Simplyfying stuff for others, making the world a place worth living
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in general
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on none for now. I'm just exploring. I want to someday be able to join Battlebots for fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at asistinmichael@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His/Him... but during coffee shortages, "Why/Me?!"
- ⚡ Fun fact: RedBull is my secret sauce—because why have wings when you can have jet engines? Big fan of Dexter's Lab; spent my childhood plotting to turn my garage into a secret laboratory. Grew up admiring the Mythbusters, which led me to Civil Engineering—because who doesn’t love blowing stuff up with science?
